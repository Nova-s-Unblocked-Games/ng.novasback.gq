Hey you! Just a note, but this is NOT mine. I give ALL CREDITS TO @ellieeet123 and others. I made this for my school so yeah. :) -Nova



Rest in peace..
The website and ALL github.io website were sadly, BLOCKED. I cant bypass literal blocking so which means that the website is officially dead. I know no one will read this because people probably dont know that this website is hosted on github. Theres some good things and some bad things. People wont remember this and it will go in the books as nothing. Good thing is that my goal was done. The main goal for this website was to get it blocked. Well, it did. Becuase of my fault, I got all github.io website blocked. Sorry. This is the end of games. I call the website officially DISCONTINUED. I wont work on it now since no one will be using it. The website will still be up and running. I will miss this website. I had good memories with it, so much time was takes for the good! This is my final post. Goodbye, and happy gaming!
